## Finger Joint Detection

This project uses TensorFlow.js and a pre-trained hand-pose detection model (MediaPipe Hands) to identify the number of extended fingers in an image uploaded by the user.

### How to Run

1.  Open the `finger-joint-detection/index.html` file in your web browser.
2.  Wait for the model to load.
3.  Click the "Upload Image" button and select an image of a hand.
4.  The AI will analyze the image, draw the hand skeleton, and display the detected number of fingers.

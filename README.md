# Canvas Gemini Examples

This repository contains a collection of interactive examples built with machine learning models and the HTML Canvas.

## Finger Joint Detection

This project uses TensorFlow.js and a pre-trained hand-pose detection model (MediaPipe Hands) to identify the number of extended fingers in an image uploaded by the user.

### How to Run

1.  Open the `finger-joint-detection/index.html` file in your web browser.
2.  Wait for the model to load.
3.  Click the "Upload Image" button and select an image of a hand.
4.  The AI will analyze the image, draw the hand skeleton, and display the detected number of fingers.

## Body Health Detection

This project uses TensorFlow.js and the MoveNet pose detection model to monitor your posture in real-time and provide feedback for ergonomic sitting.

### How to Run

1. Open the `body-health-detection/index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Allow access to your camera when prompted.
3. Sit in front of your camera and the system will track your posture.
4. Receive alerts when you slouch, tilt your head, or maintain poor posture for too long.

## Reinforcement Learning Tutorial

An interactive visualization of Q-Learning, demonstrating how an AI agent learns to find treasure through trial and error.

### How to Run

1. Open the `RL-tutorial/index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Click "Start Training" to watch the agent learn.
3. Toggle displays to see the Q-table (agent's memory) and decision logs.
4. View the Theory page to learn about the underlying principles of Q-Learning.
